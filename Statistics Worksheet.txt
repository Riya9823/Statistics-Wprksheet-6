10. Bayes' Theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.
    The formula is:
                  
                  P(A|B) =  P(A) P(B|A)P(B) 

      Which tells us:	 	how often A happens given that B happens, written P(A|B),
      When we know:	 	how often B happens given that A happens, written P(B|A)
 	 	  and how likely A is on its own, written P(A)
 	 	  and how likely B is on its own, written P(B)
11. Z-score (also called a standard score) gives you an idea of how far from the mean a data point is. But more technically itâ€™s a measure of how many standard deviations
    below or above the population mean a raw score is.  
    The formula is:
                  
                  Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}

           Z	=	standard score
           x	=	observed value
           \mu	=	mean of the sample
           \sigma	=	standard deviation of the sample
12. A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features. 
    The formula is:
               
                 t=\frac{m-\mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
 
            t	=	Student's t-test
            m	=	mean
            \mu	=	theoretical value
            s	=	standard deviation
            {n}	=	variable set size
13. A percentile is a type of quantile which divides the given probability distribution, or sample, into 100 equal-sized intervals; this allows the data to be analyzed in
    terms of percentages.Percentile scores indicate the percentage of scores within a specific external comparison group that are lower than an individual test taker's score.
14. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts: systematic factors
    and random factors. The systematic factors have a statistical influence on the given data set, while the random factors do not.
15. Analysts use the ANOVA test to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study. In other words, they help you to
    figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.
